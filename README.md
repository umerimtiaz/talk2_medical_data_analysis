# talk2_medical_data_analysis
The project aims to develop a conversational AI system to interact with a breast cancer prognosis repository, generate explanations and predictions based on the data, and provide insights to healthcare professionals and patients.
The project will develop a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the LLM model and ask questions about breast cancer prognosis. The interface will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user input and generate responses based on the LLM model's predictions.
This project will be hosted at umerai.com at later stages of project completion,for general use.
